# ðŸ§  Machine Learning & AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of end-to-end Machine Learning and AI projects. This repository is designed to showcase not just model-building, but the full ML lifecycle â€” from problem definition and training to deployment on scalable infrastructure using modern DevOps and MLOps tools.

Each project is independently packaged, containerized, and deployed using production-grade technologies such as Docker, AWS Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, EKS, and TensorFlow Serving.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### ðŸ“‰ [Churn Prediction](./Churn_Prediction)
A classification project predicting customer churn based on user activity and engagement.

**Key Features:**
- Trained using Logistic Regression via `scikit-learn`
- Dockerized for local deployment
- Deployed to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- Includes:
  - Test scripts for local/remote inference
  - Model file versioning
  - JSON-based request examples

### ðŸ‘• [Cloth Classification](./Cloth_Classification)
A deep learning project for image classification using transfer learning and multi-platform deployment.

**Key Features:**
- Built with a pretrained **Xception** model
- Converted to **TensorFlow Lite** for lightweight serving
- Deployed in 3 ways:
  - **AWS Lambda** (serverless)
  - **EKS** (Kubernetes)
  - **TF Serving with Docker Compose**
- Includes training notebooks and custom request scripts

### ðŸš— [Used Car Price Prediction](./Used_Car_Price_Prediction_no_functions)
A regression project estimating the price of used cars from tabular data.

**Key Features:**
- Cleaned and explored structured CSV data
- Trained with regression models in a Jupyter notebook
- Demonstrates rapid prototyping with interpretable outputs
